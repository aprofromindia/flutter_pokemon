# Flutter Redux, Async Await demo

A Flutter app demoing the redux integration and async await.

## Getting Started

- Please install [flutter](https://flutter.dev/) from [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- Please open the project using Android studio with flutter plugin installed.
- cd into the project root folder and then type `flutter pub get && flutter pub run build_runner watch`
- run the app using a platform (iOS/Android) of your choice.


The app showcases the following best practices while developing a flutter app using : -

- [Redux](https://pub.dev/packages/redux/versions/2.1.0) for state management.
- [Redux thunks](https://pub.dev/packages/redux_thunk) for asynchronous actions.
- Redux code structure using the [ducks pattern](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux).
- [json_serialisation](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) library for JSON decoding. 
- Added localisation support using IntelliJ [Flutter l18n plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10128-flutter-i18n).
