# Flutter Redux, Async Await demo

A Flutter app demoing the redux integration and async await.

## Getting Started

- Please install [flutter](https://flutter.dev/) using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by typing `brew install flutter`
- Please open the project using Android studio with flutter plugin.
- cd into the project root folder and then type `flutter packages get && flutter pub run build_runner watch`
- run the app using a platform (iOS/Android) of your choice.


The app showcases the following best practices while developing a flutter app using : -

- Redux for state management.
- Redux thunk for asynchronous actions.
- Redux code structure using the [ducks pattern](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux).
- [json_serialisation](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) library for JSON decoding.
